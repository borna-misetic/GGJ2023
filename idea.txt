farmer 
farma in the backyard
some of it strats to rot
seems like giant green roots are sucking his plants dry
he digs a tunnel under his garden to get to the root of the problem
the rock is too hard to dig through but he can dig through the roots themselves
he starts digging

he finds that the roots are rich with an exotic material so he sells the roots he digs up as raw material

he uses that money to buy upgrades like a better shovel, a hoe, maybe a watering bucket etc.



in the end he reaches a giant potato like thing in a hollow cave thats hung up with its green evil roots
BOSS BATTLE COMMENCES

the farmer uses his new gardening tools (maybe even a chainsaw) to fight off the plague ridden plant
LIKE PLANTERA

he then gets rich by farming this evil plant in little pots :)
